## JavaFX

- The app use JavaFX for GUI implementation.

## SQLite

- The app use SQLite for storing data in the database (locally)
- The data is stored on : C://sqlite/db

## What does this app do?

- It lets you create notes and assign categories for them to be able to filter what you want
- You can change status of the notes to completed or non-completed, this lets you remove completed notes but still have access to them as they are still stored (click on Completed Notes button to find them)


## What still needs to be done?
- The styling for this app is not done therefore it only uses basic GUI design.
- Add an account system and store all the information in a server as well in case of local data loss.
- Add a project system where you can have different projects each with its own notes separated from the others
